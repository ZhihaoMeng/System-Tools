This project contains one single c file, which parses disk images, and
prints out information about the files that the image contains, including
recoverable files that someone has tried to delete.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

There is no obvious known problem with this project.

DESIGN:

notjustcats.c navigates the provided FAT12 filesystem through a call to
decodeFAT12, which decode FAT12 and store in arr. recFiles checks
for either file or directory status and reads the data as is appropriate.
recFiles and writeFile makes use of decodeFAT12 to decode the byte entries
and find the appropriate logical clusters for the object. Finally, a call to
writeFile is made to actually create the file with the appropriate data and
file name.
