Project1 : leakcount sctracer

--------------
KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

leakcount:
1. We assume the child process will not touch the memory of the linkedlist
and will not terminate the leakcount abnormally.

sctracer:
1. I assume there are 1024 commandline arguments at most, but it could be
more than 1024. We need resize the array in that case.
2. Again the child process may terminate the parent process, which we will
lost record of previous system call and nothing sent to file I/O.
3. The output_file need to be protected, otherwise our child process
may modify it.

------
DESIGN
------

leakcount:
1. The linkedlist is used to store the pointer and size of allocated memory.
Shen a free(ptr) is called, I traverse the linkedlist and delete the 
relevent node.
2. When the destructor is called, the memory leak information will be sent
to stderr. Then the whole linkedlist will be freed.

sctracer:
1. A pretty large array is used to count the system call. 
2. Nothing special but the ptrace will send signal at the entry
and exit of system call. we just count one of them.
